# Ubiquia

> **A runtime-compiled, DAG-orchestrated, schema-driven platform for building intelligent component ecosystems ‚Äî at production scale.**

Ubiquia is a **domain-agnostic, production-grade Multi-Agent Orchestration System**. It lets you declaratively define component communication protocols and workflows, then compiles and deploys them into a **live, resilient, and self-validating distributed system** ‚Äî all from JSON schemas and YAML-ized Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG's).

---

## üåü Why Ubiquia?

Ubiquia is not another workflow engine or LLM wrapper. It's a **foundational infrastructure layer** designed to support:

- **Typed Agent communication** (via JSON Schema)
- **Runtime deployment** of distributed, RESTful belief states
- **Persistent, self-evolving DAGs** of intelligent components
- **Schema-validated I/O contracts between services**
- **Distributed system messaging with SQL-level guarantees**

Ubiquia enables a future where **LLMs**, **symbolic components**, and **software systems** can collaborate in validated, evolving ecosystems ‚Äî with no glue code.

---

## üî• Key Innovations

- üß† **Schema-to-Service Compilation**  
  Generate and deploy fully-typed REST APIs from JSON Schema definitions. No scaffolding. No boilerplate. Just the schema.

- üó∫Ô∏è **Declarative DAGs ‚Üí Kubernetes Agents**  
  Define a multi-component system with a single YAML file. Ubiquia reads the DAG and deploys it to Kubernetes ‚Äî each node a live, stateful microservice.

- üåç **Cross-Cluster DAG Communication**  
  DAGs can span **multiple Kubernetes clusters**, enabling components to operate across physical or cloud boundaries. This supports:
  - **Resilient compute**: workloads can route around degraded or partitioned clusters  
  - **Topology-aware orchestration**: components and DAG nodes can execute **close to data, users, or compute availability zones**

- üß¨ **Distributed Belief State via Configurable SQL Backend**  
  Agents share a global belief state backed by a **relational SQL database**, with support for either:
  - **YugabyteDB** for distributed, horizontally scalable, highly available environments  
  - **H2** for lightweight, in-memory or single-node scenarios such as local dev, testing, or compute-constrained environments

- üßæ **Runtime Schema Enforcement**  
  Every I/O channel between components is validated in real time. No brittle prompt logic, no undefined behavior ‚Äî just contract-based communication.

- üîÑ **Recursive System Evolution** *(Experimental)*  
  DAGs and belief schemas can be evolved by components themselves, opening the door to recursive intelligence: **AutoGPT, but type-safe and production-ready.**

- üß∞ **Spring Boot + Helm + Gradle**  
  Built on rock-solid Java infrastructure and Kubernetes-native deployment patterns. DevOps-friendly and cloud-ready.

## Quickstart
The quickest way to get up and running with Ubiquia is to follow this section.

### Quickstart: Requirements
Before running Ubiquia, make sure the following tools are installed:

| Tool        | Minimum Version | Install Link |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Helm        | 3.12.0          | [helm.sh/docs](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) |
| KIND        | 0.20.0          | [kind.sigs.k8s.io](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installing-with-go-install) |
| Kubectl     | 1.27.0          | [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) |
| Docker      | 24.0.0          | [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) |

### Quickstart: Scripts
Some convenience scripts are provided to users in this repo to get users up and running. ***The scripts must be executed in the root Ubiquia directory.***

### Quickstart: Scripts - One-Time Setup
These scripts should only ever need to be run once.
```bash
$ ./scripts/devs/helm-repo-setup.sh
```

### Quickstart: Scripts - Recurring Setup
These scripts need to be run whenever you want to do a fresh install of Ubiquia in a new KIND cluster.

```bash
$ ./scripts/devs/install-ubiquia-into-kind.sh
```

After invoking the script and a successful installation, Helm will output to console how to interface with the newly-installed Ubiquia component.

### Quickstart: Deleting Ubiquia Cluster
If you ran the above script to install Ubiquia into KIND and want a completely fresh start, you can delete the KIND Kubernetes cluster

```bash
$ kind delete clusters ubiquia-component-0
```

Now you can re-run the installation script with a fresh Kubernetes cluster!

### Getting Started: Installation
Ubiquia should be able to be installed into any Kubernetes environment using Helm as a package manager. Ubiquia's configurable values are listed in the values.yaml file. Specific configurations are available to devs that override a subset of these values. They can be found in 'helm/configurations/'.

Example Ubiquia Installation
```bash
$ helm install ubiquia ubiquia-helm --values helm/configurations/featherwweight.yaml -n ubiquia
```

### Getting Started: Project Overview
Ubiquia is a modular multi-component orchestration platform designed for scalable, belief-driven AI systems running on Kubernetes.

To ensure modularity, clarity, and maintainability, the codebase is divided into subprojects. Each will eventually have its own README and design documents ‚Äî some already do, and others are coming soon.

## For Devs
This section will contain a handful of useful commands, topics, concepts, or otherwise for developers using the Ubiquia framework.

### For Devs: Building Ubiquia
The entire Ubiquia project can be built by invoking Gradle. This will task each subproject to build.
```bash
$ ./gradlew clean build
```

### For Devs: Building Subprojects
The subprojects of Ubiquia can be built by invoking specific subprojects via Gradle with a command.

Generic Example:
```bash
$ ./gradlew :<folder>:<folder>:<subproject>:<command>
```

Concrete Example:
```bash
$ ./gradlew :core:service:flow-service:build
```

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ACL (Agent Communication Language)** | A JSON Schema-based contract that defines the types of messages components can send or receive. Enforces runtime validation of component I/O. |
| **Adapter** | A software component that connects nodes in a DAG and defines how messages are transported or transformed (e.g., `publish`, `merge`, `poll`). |
| **Component** | A stateful microservice deployed as part of a DAG, capable of sending, receiving, and acting on messages according to ACLs. |
| **Componentless Adapter** | An adapter node in a DAG that performs flow control (e.g., routing, polling, merging) but does not host an component implementation. |
| **Belief State** | A shared, distributed, and SQL-backed representation of the system‚Äôs current knowledge. Agents can read from and write to it, supporting coordination and memory across the system. |
| **Belief State Generator** | A codegen service that transforms ACLs into typed Java classes and Spring Boot REST services, enabling components to interact with the belief state in a schema-safe way. |
| **Communication Service** | A reverse proxy and routing gateway that dynamically exposes core services and component/adapters based on DAG configuration. |
| **DAO (Data Access Object)** | A component that abstracts and encapsulates database interactions, commonly used to query or persist belief state entities. |
| **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** | A directed graph with no cycles, used to define component topologies and message flow in Ubiquia. DAGs are authored in YAML and compiled into orchestrated services. |
| **DAG Manifest** | A YAML configuration file that declares how a DAG and its components/adapters should be deployed, configured, and interconnected. |
| **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** | A simple object used to encapsulate data transferred between layers or services in Ubiquia. Used heavily in REST APIs. |
| **Flow Service** | A core Ubiquia microservice responsible for materializing DAGs into running components and adapters. Manages lifecycle, registration, and event querying. |
| **MAO (Multi-Agent Orchestration)** | The process of managing and coordinating interactions among components in a MAS. Ubiquia handles MAO through DAG deployment and adapter coordination. |
| **MAS (Multi-Agent System)** | A system composed of multiple intelligent components that interact or work together to perform tasks or solve problems. Ubiquia provides runtime infrastructure for these systems. |
| **Schema Registry** | A repository of JSON Schemas (ACLs) that define I/O contracts for components and services. Used for validation, code generation, and schema evolution. |
