# Ubiquia

> **A runtime-compiled, DAG-orchestrated, schema-driven platform for building intelligent agent ecosystems ‚Äî at production scale.**

Ubiquia is a **domain-agnostic, production-grade Multi-Agent Orchestration System**. It lets you declaratively define agent communication protocols and workflows, then compiles and deploys them into a **live, resilient, and self-validating distributed system** ‚Äî all from JSON schemas and YAML-ized Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG's).

---

## üåü Why Ubiquia?

Ubiquia is not another workflow engine or LLM wrapper. It's a **foundational infrastructure layer** designed to support:

- **Typed agent communication** (via JSON Schema)
- **Runtime deployment** of distributed, RESTful belief states
- **Persistent, self-evolving DAGs** of intelligent agents
- **Schema-validated I/O contracts between services**
- **Distributed system messaging with SQL-level guarantees**

Ubiquia enables a future where **LLMs**, **symbolic agents**, and **software systems** can collaborate in validated, evolving ecosystems ‚Äî with no glue code.

## üî• Key Innovations

- üß† **Schema-to-Service Compilation**  
  Generate and deploy fully-typed REST APIs from JSON Schema definitions. No scaffolding. No boilerplate. Just the schema.

- üó∫Ô∏è **Declarative DAGs ‚Üí Kubernetes Agents**  
  Define a multi-agent system with a single YAML file. Ubiquia reads the DAG and deploys it to Kubernetes ‚Äî each node a live, stateful microservice.

- üåç **Cross-Cluster DAG Communication**  
  DAGs can span **multiple Kubernetes clusters**, enabling agents to operate across physical or cloud boundaries. This supports:
  - **Resilient compute**: workloads can route around degraded or partitioned clusters  
  - **Topology-aware orchestration**: agents and DAG nodes can execute **close to data, users, or compute availability zones**

- üß¨ **Distributed Belief State via Configurable SQL Backend**  
  Agents share a global belief state backed by a **relational SQL database**, with support for either:
  - **YugabyteDB** for distributed, horizontally scalable, highly available environments  
  - **H2** for lightweight, in-memory or single-node scenarios such as local dev, testing, or compute-constrained environments

- üßæ **Runtime Schema Enforcement**  
  Every I/O channel between agents is validated in real time. No brittle prompt logic, no undefined behavior ‚Äî just contract-based communication.

- üîÑ **Recursive System Evolution** *(Experimental)*  
  DAGs and belief schemas can be evolved by agents themselves, opening the door to recursive intelligence: **AutoGPT, but type-safe and production-ready.**

- üß∞ **Spring Boot + Helm + Gradle**  
  Built on rock-solid Java infrastructure and Kubernetes-native deployment patterns. DevOps-friendly and cloud-ready.

## Quickstart
The quickest way to get up and running with Ubiquia is to follow this section.

### Quickstart: Requirements
Before running Ubiquia, there are a few requirements that must be met.

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) has been installed
- [KIND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installing-with-go-install) has been installed
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) has been installed
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) has been installed (required by KIND)

### Quickstart: Scripts
Some convenience scripts are provided to users in this repo to get users up and running. ***The scripts must be executed in the root Ubiquia directory.***

### Quickstart: Scripts - One-Time Setup
These scripts should only ever need to be run once.
```bash
$ ./scripts/devs/helm-repo-setup.sh
```

### Quickstart: Scripts - Recurring Setup
These scripts need to be run whenever you want to do a fresh install of Ubiquia in a new KIND cluster.

```bash
$ ./scripts/devs/install-ubiquia-into-kind.sh
```

After invoking the script and a successful installation, Helm will output to console how to interface with the newly-installed Ubiquia agent.

### Quickstart: Deleting Ubiquia Cluster
If you ran the above script to install Ubiquia into KIND and want a completely fresh start, you can delete the KIND Kubernetes cluster

```bash
$ kind delete clusters ubiquia-agent-0
```

Now you can re-run the installation script with a fresh Kubernetes cluster!


## Getting Started

### Getting Started: Requirements
Before running Ubiquia, there are a few requirements that must be met.

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) has been installed
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) has been installed


### Getting Started: Installation
Ubiquia should be able to be installed into any Kubernetes environment using Helm as a package manager. Ubiquia's configurable values are listed in the values.yaml file. Specific configurations are available to devs that override a subset of these values. They can be found in 'helm/configurations/'.

Example Ubiquia Installation
```bash
$ helm install ubiquia ubiquia-helm --values helm/configurations/featherwweight.yaml -n ubiquia
```

## For Devs
This section will contain a handful of useful commands, topics, concepts, or otherwise for developers using the Ubiquia framework.

### For Devs: Building Ubiquia
The entire Ubiquia project can be built by invoking Gradle. This will task each subproject to build.
```bash
$ ./gradlew clean build
```

### For Devs: Building Subprojects
The subprojects of Ubiquia can be built by invoking specific subprojects via Gradle with a command.

Generic Example:
```bash
$ ./gradlew :<folder>:<folder>:<subproject>:<command>
```

Concrete Example:
```bash
$ ./gradlew :core:service:flow-service:build
```

## Who Is This For?

- **ML engineers** who want LLM agents with schema validation  
- **Backend developers** who want to design systems with declarative intent and runtime validation  
- **Systems engineers** building distributed or autonomous orchestration platforms  
- **Scientists & researchers** modeling intelligent ecosystems or recursive planners  
- **DoD/IC technologists** looking to modernize simulation, orchestration, or planning infrastructure
