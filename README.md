# Ubiquia

> **Ubiquia is a distributed, schema-driven multi-agent orchestration system. Define agent DAGs declaratively, and Ubiquia automatically deploys and wires them into a live Kubernetes ecosystem‚Äîwith optional belief state services for distributed, persistent, queryable shared context. All data is governed by schemas, ensuring reliable structure across all agents and components--including LLMs.**

---

## üåü Why Ubiquia?

Modern agent-based systems often rely on brittle glue code: ad-hoc APIs, hand-rolled orchestration, and inconsistent state handling. **Ubiquia replaces that mess with clean, declarative infrastructure**:

- üîÅ **Composable DAGs**  
  Describe workflows as YAML-based DAGs. Ubiquia spins up agents, components, adapters, belief states, and communication services on demand.

- üì¶ **Schema-to-Belief Pipelines**  
  Provide an Agent Communication Language (i.e., JSON Schema), and Ubiquia will deploy a **RESTful Belief State service** with:  
  - Distributed persistence  
  - A fully-typed REST API generated from your schema  
  - A relational back-end  
  - An expressive, intuitive query API with paginated results
  - Real-time ingestion of normalized relational data

- üß¨ **Schema-Driven Stability**  
  Prevent long-term degeneration in multi-agent systems. Every I/O channel is bound to a contract defined in JSON Schema, keeping agents‚Äîincluding LLMs‚Äîgrounded in clean, structured, machine-validated data.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Kubernetes-Native by Design**  
  Helm-first deployments, Prometheus & Micrometer observability baked in. Built for production from day one.

- üåç **Cross-Cluster DAG Communication**  
  DAGs can span **multiple Kubernetes clusters**, enabling components to operate across physical and cloud boundaries:  
  - **Resilient Compute**: workloads can route around degraded or partitioned clusters  
  - **Topology-Aware Execution**: deploy agents near data, users, or available compute zones

---

Unlike most MAS (Multi-Agent System) frameworks, **Ubiquia is designed from the ground up for real-world, production-grade integration**. It combines formal schema enforcement with robust deployment tooling, dynamic service generation, and cross-cluster communication‚Äîbridging the gap between research prototypes and hardened operational systems.

## Quickstart
The quickest way to get up and running with Ubiquia is to follow this section.

### Quickstart: Requirements
Before running Ubiquia, make sure the following tools are installed:

| Tool        | Minimum Version | Install Link |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Helm        | 3.12.0          | [helm.sh/docs](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) |
| KIND        | 0.20.0          | [kind.sigs.k8s.io](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installing-with-go-install) |
| Kubectl     | 1.27.0          | [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) |
| Docker      | 24.0.0          | [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) |

### Quickstart: Scripts
Some convenience scripts are provided to users in this repo to get users up and running. ***The scripts must be executed in the root Ubiquia directory.***

### Quickstart: Scripts - One-Time Setup
These scripts should only ever need to be run once.
```bash
$ ./scripts/devs/helm-repo-setup.sh
```

### Quickstart: Scripts - Recurring Setup
These scripts need to be run whenever you want to do a fresh install of Ubiquia in a new KIND cluster.

```bash
$ ./scripts/devs/install-ubiquia-into-kind.sh
```

After invoking the script and a successful installation, Helm will output to console how to interface with the newly-installed Ubiquia component.

### Quickstart: Deleting Ubiquia Cluster
If you ran the above script to install Ubiquia into KIND and want a completely fresh start, you can delete the KIND Kubernetes cluster

```bash
$ kind delete clusters ubiquia-component-0
```

Now you can re-run the installation script with a fresh Kubernetes cluster!

### Getting Started: Installation
Ubiquia should be able to be installed into any Kubernetes environment using Helm as a package manager. Ubiquia's configurable values are listed in the values.yaml file. Specific configurations are available to devs that override a subset of these values. They can be found in 'helm/configurations/'.

Example Ubiquia Installation
```bash
$ helm install ubiquia ubiquia-helm --values helm/configurations/featherwweight.yaml -n ubiquia
```

### Getting Started: Project Overview
Ubiquia is a modular multi-component orchestration platform designed for scalable, belief-driven AI systems running on Kubernetes.

To ensure modularity, clarity, and maintainability, the codebase is divided into subprojects. Each will eventually have its own README and design documents ‚Äî some already do, and others are coming soon.

## Agent Communication Language
Ubiquia revolves around the the idea that schemas are necessary to prevent Multi-Agent systems from collapsing under their own weight. To battle entropy at scale, Ubiquia requires an Agent Communication Language (ACL) before orchestrating any DAGs or Belief States. ACLs are themselves really minimal metadata around the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) specification.

### Agent Communication Language: Defining ACLs
Here's an example ACL:

```json

## Belief States

Ubiquia allows clients to deploy fully RESTful, schema-validating, queryable **Belief State** services directly from an Agent Communication Language (ACL ‚Äî really just JSON Schema). These services are automatically deployed into Kubernetes and support both ingestion and querying of relational data out of the box.

---

### Belief States: Querying Data

Belief State services expose dynamic query capabilities via the `/query/params/` endpoint. These endpoints validate all fields at runtime‚Äîinvalid or unknown fields will result in HTTP errors.

Query endpoints are also **polymorphic**: querying a base model (e.g., `Animal`) may return instances of all subtypes (e.g., `Cat`, `Dachshund`).

---

#### Supported Operators

In addition to `equals`, the following operators are available directly in a GET request:

| Operator              | Syntax   |
|-----------------------|----------|
| less than or equal    | `<=`     |
| greater than or equal | `>=`     |
| equals null           | `=null`  |
| not null              | `=!null` |
| string match (like)   | `*=`     |

---

#### Example: Query by Parameters
Ubiquia's generated Belief States support querying data via URL GET endpoints:

```http
GET /ubiquia/belief-state-service/animal/query/params?page=0&size=25&sort-descending=true&created-at>=2022-08-30T21:00:00.000Z&name=!null
```

response:

```json

    }
  ],

    "pageSize": 25
  },
  "totalElements": 2,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "numberOfElements": 2,

  "last": true
}
```

#### Example: Relational Queries
Ubiquia Belief States support querying for relational data, out of the box:

```http
GET /ubiquia/belief-state-service/animal/query/params?page=0&size=25&sort-descending=true&created-at>=2022-08-30T21:00:00.000Z&owner.name=Mark
```

response:

```json
{
    "content": [
        {
            "id": "daad6ddd-c060-4f52-ada3-f81e099948f2",
            "name": "Fang",
            "modelType": "Cat",
            "createdAt": "2022-11-02T14:26:45.244Z",
            "updatedAt": "2022-11-02T14:26:45.244Z",
            "whiskers": 10,
            "owner": {
                "name": "Mark",
                "id": "cbad6ddd-c060-4f52-ada3-f81e099948f2",
                "modelType": "Person",
                "createdAt": "2022-11-02T14:26:45.244Z",
                "updatedAt": "2022-11-02T14:26:45.244Z"
            }
        }
    ],
    "pageable": {
        "sort": {
            "empty": true,
            "sorted": false,
            "unsorted": true
        },
        "offset": 0,
        "pageSize": 25,
        "pageNumber": 0,
        "paged": true,
        "unpaged": false
    },

        "unsorted": true
    },
    "first": true,
    "numberOfElements": 1,
    "empty": false
}
```

### Querying Data: Multiselect

Belief States support "multiselect" endpoints that allow clients to define ONLY the fields that they would like back from a RESTful query for performance-minded queries. These endpoints support pagination, sorting, and the sort. 

Multiselect syntax:

```http
GET /ubiquia/belief-state-service/animal/query/multiselect/params?page=0&size=1&multiselect-fields=createdAt,updatedAt
```

Multiselect Response:

```json
{
  "content": [
    [
      "2024-04-26T19:54:30.158154Z",
      "2024-04-26T19:54:31.103444Z"
    ]
  ],
  "number": 0,
  "size": 1,
  "totalElements": 5,
  "pageable": {
    "pageNumber": 0,
    "pageSize": 1,
    "sort": {
      "empty": true,
      "sorted": false,
      "unsorted": true
    },
    "offset": 0,
    "unpaged": false,
    "paged": true
  },
  "last": false,
  "totalPages": 5,
  "sort": {
    "empty": true,
    "sorted": false,
    "unsorted": true
  },
  "first": true,
  "numberOfElements": 1,
  "empty": false
}
```

## For Devs
This section will contain a handful of useful commands, topics, concepts, or otherwise for developers using the Ubiquia framework.

### For Devs: Building Ubiquia
The entire Ubiquia project can be built by invoking Gradle. This will task each subproject to build.
```bash
$ ./gradlew clean build
```

### For Devs: Building Subprojects
The subprojects of Ubiquia can be built by invoking specific subprojects via Gradle with a command.

Generic Example:
```bash
$ ./gradlew :<folder>:<folder>:<subproject>:<command>
```

Concrete Example:
```bash
$ ./gradlew :core:service:flow-service:build
```

## Who Is This For?

- **ML engineers** who want LLM components with schema validation  
- **Backend developers** who want to design systems with declarative intent and runtime validation  
- **Systems engineers** building distributed or autonomous orchestration platforms  
- **Scientists & researchers** modeling intelligent ecosystems or recursive planners  
- **DoD/IC technologists** looking to modernize simulation, orchestration, or planning infrastructure

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ACL (Agent Communication Language)** | A JSON Schema-based contract that defines the types of messages components can send or receive. Enforces runtime validation of component I/O. |
| **Adapter** | A software component that connects nodes in a DAG and defines how messages are transported or transformed (e.g., `publish`, `merge`, `poll`). |
| **Component** | A stateful microservice deployed as part of a DAG, capable of sending, receiving, and acting on messages according to ACLs. |
| **Componentless Adapter** | An adapter node in a DAG that performs flow control (e.g., routing, polling, merging) but does not host an component implementation. |
| **Belief State** | A shared, distributed, and SQL-backed representation of the system‚Äôs current knowledge. Agents can read from and write to it, supporting coordination and memory across the system. |
| **Belief State Generator** | A codegen service that transforms ACLs into typed Java classes and Spring Boot REST services, enabling components to interact with the belief state in a schema-safe way. |
| **Communication Service** | A reverse proxy and routing gateway that dynamically exposes core services and component/adapters based on DAG configuration. |
| **DAO (Data Access Object)** | A component that abstracts and encapsulates database interactions, commonly used to query or persist belief state entities. |
| **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** | A directed graph with no cycles, used to define component topologies and message flow in Ubiquia. DAGs are authored in YAML and compiled into orchestrated services. |
| **DAG Manifest** | A YAML configuration file that declares how a DAG and its components/adapters should be deployed, configured, and interconnected. |
| **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** | A simple object used to encapsulate data transferred between layers or services in Ubiquia. Used heavily in REST APIs. |
| **Flow Service** | A core Ubiquia microservice responsible for materializing DAGs into running components and adapters. Manages lifecycle, registration, and event querying. |
| **MAO (Multi-Agent Orchestration)** | The process of managing and coordinating interactions among components in a MAS. Ubiquia handles MAO through DAG deployment and adapter coordination. |
| **MAS (Multi-Agent System)** | A system composed of multiple intelligent components that interact or work together to perform tasks or solve problems. Ubiquia provides runtime infrastructure for these systems. |
| **Schema Registry** | A repository of JSON Schemas (ACLs) that define I/O contracts for components and services. Used for validation, code generation, and schema evolution. |
