# Architecture Decision Record: Multi-Agent Ubiquia

## Decision
Ubiquia will be a decentralized, distributed, heterogenous, autonomous, multi-agent software system. 

## Status 

### [1.0.0] - 2025-07-01
- Accepted.

## Summary 

### Pros
- System is "tough"; can survive military conflict
- Allows for dynamic, emergent, _autonomous_ system behavior.

### Cons
- Emergent, dynamic behavior will require magnitudes more testing "scaffolding"
- Much more difficult to implement
- Much more difficult to debug/diagnose issues

### Alternatives
- Monolith

## Context
Ubiquia is a software system designed to survive a military conflict. In a major military conflict with a near-peer or even peer adversary, it should be expected that the United States Department of Defense will lose assets, up to and including entire sites via kinetic strikes. Even on the lowest end of the conflict spectrum, it should be expected that weapon systems can expect degraded networks (most likely through cyber means.) It is imperative, then, that weapon systems are designed with this in mind. As such, Ubiquia is designed to be a decentalized, heteregenous software system such that any individual agent can perform the entirety of Ubiquia's mission should any single agent lose contact with other agents.

It is also important to note that in a major military conflict, strikes of all forms (kinetic, cyber, etc.) will most likely happen concurrently with the intent to overwhelm. In such a conflict, timelines will be short and the fog of war will reign. Given this, it is important that Ubiquia be able to work autonomously.

Each agent of Ubiquia should--computational resources allowing--be able to perform the entirety of Ubiquia's mission. A collection of Ubiquia agents, then, will be more than the sum of their parts - they will be able to communicate amongst themselves to specialize on tasks given the computational resources and constraints avaialable to each agent.

## Consequences & Tradeoffs
The consequences of this is that Ubiquia is an exceedingly-difficult software project requiring deep software-engineering experience. While such a system is about as resilient as can be to military strikes, it does not come without tradeoffs. Loosely-coupled, distributed systems are much more demanding of software developers: they are more difficult to build well, more difficult to test well, and exponentially more difficult to debug when things inevitably go wrong. In other words, it is extremely difficult to implement a distributed software system. Add to this that Ubiquia is also autonomous and agent-based, and it becomes something of an "architect's dream, a developer's nightmare." Moreover, due to the agent-based nature of Ubiquia, certain behaviors of the system will only become apparent at scale. These are, in effect, emergent behaviors with all of the edge cases that those imply.

Therefore, not only will implementation of such a system be exponentially more difficult than other systems, so too will the testing of it. It is almost by necessity that Ubiquia will require a robust "digital twin environment" in order to test Ubiquia's multi-agent, distributed, autonomous capabilities under the sort of conditions expected in a miltary conflict. This digital twin environment--itself a fiendishly-complicated software system--will practically be a pre-requisite before Ubiquia itself can be fully realized.
